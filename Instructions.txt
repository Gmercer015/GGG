INSTRUCTIONS: \n
The goal of the game is to shoot your opponent with \n
your 'H' Gun. Each player is given 3 moves per turn \n
to either move or shoot. The 'G's are the unbreakable \n
tiles that limit the map. the character'#' represents a \n
barrier. these barriers can block one beam of your H's \n
before melting into a '^', which acts as nothing. NOTE \n
that this map can be edited using the notepad file MAP, \n
feel free to create your own map using the symbols provided \n
on the default map. \n \n Things to note:
shooting DOES count as a turn. \n
The 'B' represents playerone while the \n
'O' represents player two \n
The menu system may be a little glitchy \n
You can edit the map inside the main folder \n \n \n

feel free to contact me about suggesstions and \n 
ideas for the game! \n \n
